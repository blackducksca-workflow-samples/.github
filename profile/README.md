## Overview

### What is Black Duck SCA? 

<details>
<summary><strong>üìñ Click to learn when and why you need SCA scanning</strong></summary>

### üîç What SCA Detects:
- **Security Vulnerabilities:** Known CVEs in open source components with CVSS severity ratings
- **License Compliance Issues:** License conflicts and policy violations in dependencies
- **Outdated Components:** Libraries with available security patches or newer versions
- **Operational Risks:** End-of-life components and maintenance status

### ‚è∞ When Users Need SCA:
- **Pre-deployment:** Before releasing applications to production
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Ongoing scanning of existing applications
- **Dependency Updates:** When adding or updating third-party libraries
- **Compliance Audits:** During security assessments and regulatory reviews

### üë• Critical User Scenarios:
- **Pull Request Validation:** Block PRs introducing vulnerable dependencies
- **Release Gate Controls:** Prevent deployment of applications with critical CVEs
- **Incident Response:** Rapid identification of affected components during security breaches
- **Vendor Assessments:** Generate security reports for customer requirements

### üí∞ Business Impact:
- **Risk Reduction:** Prevent security breaches from vulnerable dependencies
- **Compliance Assurance:** Meet regulatory and contractual obligations
- **Cost Avoidance:** Avoid expensive post-deployment security fixes
- **Reputation Protection:** Maintain customer trust through proactive security

### üö® Key Triggers for SCA Implementation:
- **Customer security questionnaires** requiring vulnerability reports
- **Regulatory compliance mandates** (SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR)
- **Security incidents** involving third-party components
- **Merger & acquisition** due diligence requirements
- **Insurance requirements** for cyber liability coverage
