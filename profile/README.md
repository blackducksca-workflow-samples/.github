## Overview

## What is Black Duck SCA? 

<details>
<summary><strong>üìñ Click to learn when and why you need SCA scanning</strong></summary>

### üîç What SCA Detects:
- **Security Vulnerabilities:** Known CVEs with CVSS scores, exploit availability, and remediation paths
- **License Risks:** GPL conflicts, commercial restrictions, attribution requirements, copyleft obligations
- **Supply Chain Threats:** Malicious packages, typosquatting attacks, compromised dependencies
- **Technical Debt:** Outdated libraries, end-of-life components, unmaintained projects

### ‚è∞ When Users Need SCA:
- **Pre-Commit:** Developer workstation scanning before code submission
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automated build validation and release gate enforcement  
- **Production Monitoring:** Continuous vulnerability tracking and new CVE alerting
- **Compliance Events:** Audit preparation, customer security reviews, regulatory reporting

### üë• Critical User Scenarios:
- **Developers:** *"Is this dependency secure?"* ‚Üí Instant vulnerability and license validation
- **Security Teams:** *"Are we affected by the latest CVE?"* ‚Üí Rapid impact assessment across all applications
- **Legal Teams:** *"Can we distribute this commercially?"* ‚Üí License compliance verification and risk analysis
- **DevOps Teams:** *"Should we block this deployment?"* ‚Üí Risk-based release decisions with clear thresholds

### üí∞ Business Impact:
- **Risk Mitigation:** 96% of applications contain open source code; 84% have known vulnerabilities *(Synopsys OSSRA 2024)*
- **Cost Avoidance:** Average security breach costs $4.88M; prevention costs significantly less *(IBM Security 2024)*
- **Compliance Assurance:** Automated license tracking prevents legal disputes and contract violations
- **Developer Velocity:** Early detection reduces fixing costs by 100x compared to production remediation

### üö® Key Triggers for SCA Implementation:
- **Security Incidents:** Vulnerability exploits in your technology stack
- **Compliance Requirements:** SOX, GDPR, HIPAA mandating software inventory
- **Customer Demands:** Enterprise buyers requiring security attestations
- **Supply Chain Attacks:** SolarWinds-style incidents highlighting third-party risks
- **Developer Productivity:** Reducing time spent on manual security research

**Bottom Line:** SCA is essential for any organization using open source components (99% of modern applications) to manage security, legal, and operational risks effectively.

| [**Run scans asynchronously to avoid holding up the pipeline during scanning**](https://github.com/blackducksca-workflow-samples/async-mode) | By default, the pipeline is held until the scan finishes. You can configure the workflow in such a way where the pipeline doesn't wait for the scan to finish and returns immediately after kicking off the scan. Note that post scan options are not triggered when you choose to not wait for the scan to finish | [Workflow](https://github.com/blackducksca-workflow-samples/async-mode/blob/main/.github/workflows/nodejs-npm.yml) | [Results](https://blackducksca-workflow-samples.github.io/async-mode/) |
